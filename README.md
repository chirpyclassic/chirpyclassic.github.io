  "Hels;d,,4tedfc"
  "He;;hhh... You Shoulden't Be Here, Kid..."

  You hear an ominous chime come from behind you. Another presence is suddenly in the area with you where, previously, you were completely alone. Defenseless. At the mercy of whatever cruelty God decided should befall you and your meager, puny existence. And it seems God decided to be as cruel as he possibly could to you today, as you turn, shaking, to see chirpyclassic standing behind you.
  
  Their eyes are closed. They wear a heavy blue jacket and black gym shorts. On their feet, fuzzy pink slippers. The bird that, on normal occassions, would be resting on their head, is absent.
  
  Their eyes open. You know this is the end.
  
  One is empty. The other glows a radiant blue that strikes fear in your soul.
  
  "You Readey to Have a Rather Unenjoyable Experiencese??" they say in a low voice.

  You shake your head, tears flowing from your eyes. You just want to see your family again.
  
  chirpyclassic cackles.
  
  "2 abd!23/!/2!?4@#5?45ryfv" they cry out as they vaporize you.
  
  the end bad end
